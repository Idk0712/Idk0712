- Hey, I'm just a coder that likes coding, especially changing things in moomoo.io, like I made for example a gameUI changer.
- I have discord, my discord is scripter1.
- I'm not a pro at coding but I guess I can call myself good.
- If you want take a look at some of my work and try learning this way, I started learning javascript like that.
- But at the beginning I was just a newbie.
- And then I watched a full course for javascript.
